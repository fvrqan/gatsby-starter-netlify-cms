### Hi! I'm Furqan Maudhudy. I'm an IT & Design officer building website projects and writing about programming.

I went through a career change from marketing to IT Design in 2020, and I've been documenting everything I learn ever since.

### Philosophy

I want to create a beautiful space on the internet, and inspire others to do so as well. That's why my site has no ads, affiliates, sponsors, tracking, analytics, or social media. If you would like to support what I do and my content has helped you out in your learning journey, you can buy me a coffee.
